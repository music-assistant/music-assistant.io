The Music Assistant integration for Home Assistant provides a connection from MA to HA. This means that MA players are visible in HA and can be controlled via the HA UI or via automations or scripts.

- [Announcements](/integration/announcements/) from HA in the form of Text to Speech or audio files are fully supported.

- With some additional setup [voice control of MA](/integration/voice/) via HA is also possible

- The integration can connect to the MA server which is running either as an HA addon or as a docker container on the same or another host system

- The integration is an official part of Home Assistant, there is no need to install custom components

Note that there is also a [Home Assistant provider](/player-support/ha/) within MA which functions the other way around. It enables Home Assistant functionality (and players) in Music Assistant!
