All Player Providers have settings which can be configured. The settings page will look similar to the following. The question mark icon in the top right is a hyperlink to the relevant page in this documentation. Specific help for a setting or configurable field is often available and is accessed by selecting this icon ![image](/assets/icons/question-mark.png). All providers can be given a custom name and disabled if necessary. The log level can be adjusted for all providers and is found in the advanced settings. (Do not select Verbose unless asked for by a dev as it can have an adverse performance impact). See the provider pages for any provider specific settings (many have none) and the [Individual Player Settings](/settings/individual-player/) page.
