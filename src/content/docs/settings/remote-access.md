Remote Access allows you to securely connect to your Music Assistant server from anywhere in the world.

## Configuration

- Toggle the Remote Access Status to on
- For those with a Nabu Casa subscription, ensure the option `WebRTC Connections` (in the Home Assistant Cloud settings) is ON

:::note
A Nabu Casa subscription is not required for this functionality unless running in a complex network environment. For example, double NAT or mobile carriers or corporate networks blocking standard <a href="https://medium.com/@jamesbordane57/what-is-a-stun-server-df3563dbf14a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">STUN servers</a>. This is where TURN servers (which Naba Casa provides) are useful as they basically relay the traffic.
