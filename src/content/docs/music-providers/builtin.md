The Builtin provider supports manually adding track and radio station URLs to the database and it also generates various [Playlists](/usage.md/#playlists).

## Features

- You can add tracks accessible via URL or any online station. You can also add your locally created stations using, for example, <a href="https://icecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Icecast</a>.

## Settings

For each of the builtin playlists there is a toggle to enable or disable them. 

## Usage

1. In the main menu select 'Tracks' or 'Radio'
2. Then click on the icon in the top right corner
