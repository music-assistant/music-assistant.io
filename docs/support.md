# Support

Because this project originated out of a Home Assistant integration, all enduser support is maintained in a separate repository. Raise issues and discuss ideas [here](https://github.com/music-assistant/support)

Direct links are:

- [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/music-assistant/support/issues) to create bug reports. Please review the [troubleshooting](faq/troubleshooting.md) page first and check if your issue has already been reported. When raising a report please include detailed info and logfiles.
- [Feature Requests](https://github.com/orgs/music-assistant/discussions/categories/feature-requests-and-ideas): Give your vote to an existing request, join the discussion or add a new request.
- [Q&A Section](https://github.com/orgs/music-assistant/discussions/categories/q-a) Frequently asked questions and tutorials

 Additionally you can seek assistance in the [discord community](https://discord.gg/kaVm8hGpne). Join the community and get support!

**Before You Ask:**

Review how to [Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

Before asking a technical question in any of our support channels, please do the following:

1. Try to find an answer by searching this documentation and [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/music-assistant/discussions)
2. Try to find an answer by searching the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/music-assistant/support/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
3. Try to find an answer by searching the Web: https://www.google.com/
4. Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.
5. Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.

When you ask your question, display the fact that you have done these things first; this will help establish that you're not being lazy and wasting people's time. Better yet, display what you have learned from doing these things. We like answering questions for people who have demonstrated they can learn from the answers.
