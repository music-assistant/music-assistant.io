# Spotify Connect ![Preview image](../assets/icons/spotify-connect-icon.png){ align=right }

Music Assistant has the ability to add [Spotify Connect](https://connect.spotify.com/) support to any MA player.

!!! note
    This plugin is still in an early stage of development. Functionality is limited and bugs may occur
    
## Features

- Any MA player can be exposed including groups

## Configuration

To make each player appear as a Spotify Connect target in the Spotify app, the Spotify Connect provider needs to be added individually for each player in the Plugins section

## Known Issues / Notes

- To use Spotify Connect, all devices must be connected to the same network. Refer to the [Spotify Connect Support Article](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-connect/) for more information (Note that any reference in that article to accessing devices from different WiFi networks isn't supported)
- If the device does not natively support announcements then playback will be interrupted if an announcement is sent to a player that is being streamed to via Spotify Connect. Currently this means that, announcements will only work on the Voice PE devices (and derivatives) and Sonos S2 devices.
- Due to the universal, [buffered nature of forwarding the Spotify Connect audio stream](https://github.com/orgs/music-assistant/discussions/419#discussioncomment-12237246) to MA players, there will be a delay (between 0.5 and 5 seconds) in sending a command from the Spotify app. Metadata can also be ahead of time.
