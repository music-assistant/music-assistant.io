# Player Provider Settings ![Preview image](../assets/icons/settings-players-icon.png){ width=70 align=right }

All Player Providers have settings which can be configured. The settings page will look similar to the following although there may not be a Generic Settings section. The text `Check out the documentation` is a hyperlink to the relevant page in this documentation. Specific help for a setting or configurable field is often available and is accessed by selecting this icon ![image](../assets/icons/question-mark.png). All providers can be given a custom name and disabled if necessary. The log level can be adjusted for all providers and is found in the advanced settings. (Do not select Verbose unless asked for by a dev as it can have an adverse performance impact). See the provider pages for any provider specific settings (many have none) and the [Individual Player Settings](individual-player.md) page.
