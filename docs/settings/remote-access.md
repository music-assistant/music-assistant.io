# Remote Access Settings ![Preview image](../assets/icons/remote-access-icon.png){ width=70 align=right }

Remote Access allows you to securely connect to your Music Assistant server from anywhere in the world.

## Configuration

- Toggle the Remote Access Status to on
- For those with a Nabu Casa subscription, ensure the option `WebRTC Connections` (in the Home Assistant Cloud settings) is ON

!!! note
    A Nabu Casa subscription is not required for this functionality unless running in a complex network environment. For example, double NAT or mobile carriers or corporate networks blocking standard [STUN servers](https://medium.com/@jamesbordane57/what-is-a-stun-server-df3563dbf14a). This is where TURN servers (which Naba Casa provides) are useful as they basically relay the traffic.

Setup is automatic and further instructions are shown in the MA UI
