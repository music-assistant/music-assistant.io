# Music Provider Settings ![Preview image](../assets/icons/settings-providers-icon.png){ width=70 align=right }

All [Music Providers](../music-providers/index.md) have settings which can be configured. The settings page will look similar to the following. The text `Check out the documentation` is a hyperlink to the relevant page in this documentation. Specific help for a setting or configurable field is often available and is accessed by selecting this icon ![question mark](../assets/icons/question-mark.png). All providers can be given a custom name and disabled if necessary. The log level can be adjusted for all providers and this is found in the advanced settings. (Do not select Verbose unless asked for by a dev as it can have an adverse performance impact). See the provider pages for provider specific settings.
