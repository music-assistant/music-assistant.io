## Generic Settings

- <b>Theme.</b> Allow selection of a light or dark theme. Options are `Auto (follow system configuration) [default]`, `Light`, and `Dark`
- <b>Language.</b> Allow selection of a light or dark theme. Options are `Auto (follow system configuration) [default]`, or a wide variety of languages. Translations are [contributed by the community](../help/lokalise.md).
- <b>Enabled menu items.</b> The menu items which can be shown are configured here. The order the items are selected is the order that they are displayed.
- <b>Force mobile layout.</b> The mobile layout has the menu at the bottom and has icons for HOME, and SEARCH and the remainder of the items are accessed via a single library icon
 
## Web Player

- <b>Web player mode.</b> The options are `Sendspin (experimental) [default]` and `Disabled (controls only)`
- <b>Sendspin sync delay (ms).</b> Static delay in milliseconds to adjust audio synchronization. Positive values delay playback, negative values advance it. Use this to compensate for device-specific audio latency.
- <b>Use browser latency detection.</b> Automatically compensate for hardware audio latency (e.g., Bluetooth headphones) using the browser's output latency API. This API is fairly new and may not work reliably on all browsers and operating systems
