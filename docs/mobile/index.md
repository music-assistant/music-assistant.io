# Mobile Devices

## Notification Screen Support

When the Music Assistant UI is accessed via a browser which supports the [mediasession API](https://caniuse.com/?search=mediasession) then a media player widget will be seen in the device's notification or lock screen. Support is available for the pause, play, next track, and previous track functions.

Whilst this functionality has been tested to work when using the iOS HA App to access the Music Assistant UI the same can not be said for the Android HA App. If desiring this functionality on an Android device then use a supported browser.

Android users should also note that they may observe a label "This Phone" when observing playback on a remote device. This is a limitation of the Android OS.

If the media player widget is not seen then a different, supported browser will need to be used.
