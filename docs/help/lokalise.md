If you're following the frontend repo, you may have seen that we are now using Lokalise as a central translation management portal.

At the time of writing the translation status for the various languages in MA is as follows

Languages will get added to the frontend when the translation percentage exceeds 75%.

We would love to support more languages but we need your help to do so.

## How can I contribute?

- Create an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/music-assistant/support/issues) stating the Language that want you to contribute.

- We will then add this language to the project in Lokalise, and resolve the issue in GitHub

- Once the issue is resolved, you'll be able to use this [sign-up link](https://app.lokalise.com/public/321419046440c0f2bba414.05634832/) to join the project as a translator.

Please only select the language that you intend to contribute to when requesting to join the team on Lokalise.
