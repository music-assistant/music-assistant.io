!!! note
    The regular `media_player.play_media` service call also accepts all of the above but it cannot take multiple items

!!! note
    When adding multiple items they must be preceded by a hyphen as shown in the images above

There are additional options as well. Enqueue will appear when an entity that supports it is selected.

!!! warning "Radio Mode"
    You can only use the album, artist, track or playlist media_type if enabling Radio Mode. Radio Mode can only be used if a provider is available which supports dynamic tracks (e.g Apple, Deezer, Spotify,  Subsonic, Tidal and YTM).
