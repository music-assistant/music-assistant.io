- Playlist creation is possible as well as adding and removing tracks from existing playlists
- Logging of played tracks in YouSee Musik, this is especially useful for getting appropriate recommendations
- Any track that YouSee Musik has lyrics for is automatically fetched in MA. If timestamps are available for a track, proper "karaoke style" lyrics are used, otherwise it fallbacks to raw text-only lyrics.
