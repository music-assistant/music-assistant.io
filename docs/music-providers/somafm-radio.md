## Configuration

- Quality can be set to Highest, High, or Low in Advanced Settings (default Highest)

## Usage

- When the SomaFM Radio provider is added, it will populate the Radio tab with all available SomaFM stations.
- If you favorite some of the stations, you can use the heart ❤️ filter at the top of the screen to show only your favorites.
- Deleting a station from the library is not a permanent solution; SomaFM's channels change from time to time, and the removed station will probably come back on the next sync.
- If the above behavior proves to be too unpopular, we can release a new version to only allow access through the Browse interface and support manual addition of stations to the Radio tab.
