## Configuration

In the configuration, there are a series of steps that must be completed in order. Start at the top of the page and work down. 

[![Tidal Config](../assets/screenshots/tidal-config.png){ width=800 }](../assets/screenshots/tidal-config.png)

1. Click on the first button and you will be redirected to the Tidal login page and after logging in you will be taken to an error page which is normal.

    [![Oops Page](../assets/screenshots/oops-page.png){ width=800 }](../assets/screenshots/oops-page.png)

2. Take the full URL in the address bar of the Oops error page and insert it into the configuration screen  

3. Click on the last button to complete the setup

## Known Issues / Notes

- If the authorisation process gets stuck then try a different browser. It is likely the authorisation pop up window is being blocked
- If login is normally accomplished with "Proceed with Google" then a workaround is required as this option is not shown on the login page used my MA for authentication. In this case login to Tidal normally using a browser. In the same browser start the authentication process via MA. A prompt should be observed to use the existing login. Accepting that should result in the error page mentioned in step 1 above. From that point proceed with steps 2 and 3 above.

## Not yet supported

- Multiple accounts (this is being worked on and available soon)
