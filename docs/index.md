## Architecture

Music Assistant consists of multiple building blocks:

- Music Assistant Server ([Installation Instructions](installation.md))
- Home Assistant Integration ([Installation Instructions](integration/installation.md))
- [Music Providers](music-providers/index.md): Import your music from various sources into Music Assistant.
- [Player Providers](player-support/index.md): Play your music on a wide collection of player ecosystems.
- Plugins: These extend the functionality of Music Assistant. Importantly, the [Home Assistant Plugin](ha-plugin.md) allows the importing of Home Assistant media players into the Music Assistant engine to use as targets for playback

## Music Assistant Server

The Music Assistant server is a free, opensource Media library manager that connects to your streaming services and a wide range of connected speakers. The server is the beating heart, the core of Music Assistant and it keeps track of your music sources. It must run on an always-on device like a Raspberry Pi, a NAS or an Intel NUC or alike. The server can access multiple music providers and stream to multiple player types.
